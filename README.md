This was my second project while studying HTML and CSS. The goal was to create a tribute page to someone I admire, so I chose Oskar Schindler. This was the first time I used Flexbox elements, which I find it very useful to make the page more dinamic. I struggled a lit bit with all the new properties I have learnt and also choosing a color palette and to be honest, not sure about the decisios I made BUT i had a great time with this one, espececially because I chose a topic that is close to my heart, which always makes the learning process easier :)
